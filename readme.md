This is my Personal Blog project made using Django. 
```
It is a simple yet powerful blog project that allows users to sign up, log in to their blog account or they can also view the blog posts created by other users on the home page without logging in. The user can also create, update, delete their blog posts once logged in into their account . The user can also update their profile information. The user can also reset their password if they forget it. The user can also like and comment on the blog posts. They can also view the blog posts specifically created by them on their profile page. 
```
The project is made using Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and SQLite database.
It uses Django's built-in authentication system for user authentication and authorization.
It uses Django's built-in class-based views, forms, and models for creating, updating, deleting blog posts, and user profile information.
It uses Django's built-in password reset functionality for resetting the user password.
It also uses font-awesome icons for the like and comment functionality.
